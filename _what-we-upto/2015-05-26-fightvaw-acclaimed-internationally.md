[YoungInnovations](http://younginnovations.com.np/) is extremely proud to announce that one of its projects, [Fight Violence Against Women (FightVAW)](http://fightvaw.org/) has won international acclaim. It has been awarded the prestigious [World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) Project Prizes](http://groups.itu.int/stocktaking/WSISProjectPrizes.aspx) under the Category 1: The role of governments and all stakeholders in the promotion of ICTs for development (C1). There were hundreds of candidates from different parts of the world and our project was selected as winner in the category following public voting and a jury panel. The prize was announced at a global ceremony held on May 26, 2015 at Geneva, Switzerland.


WSIS Project Prizes is a unique recognition for excellence in the implementation of WSIS outcomes. This initiative is an immediate response to the requests expressed by WSIS stakeholders during the [WSIS Forum 2011](http://groups.itu.int/wsis-forum2011/Home.aspx): to create a mechanism to evaluate and reward global stakeholders for their efforts in the implementation of WSIS outcomes. It is a contest that is open to all stakeholders - governments, private sectors, civil society, international organizations, academia and others. There are 18 categories that are directly linked to [WSIS Action lines](https://www.itu.int/wsis/stocktaking/help-action-lines.html) outlined in the [Geneva Plan of Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society#Geneva_Summit.2C_2003). 

Fight Violence Against Women (FightVAW) is an integrated platform that provides comprehensive solution to combat Violence against Women in Nepal through strategic use of ICTs. It provides efficient mechanism for reporting cases of violence, enhance coordination and collaboration among service providers to respond on reported cases and provide one-stop-site for data and information on gender-based violence in Nepalese context. It is the collaborative effort of YoungInnovations, [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/) and [National Women Commission (NWC)](http://www.nwc.gov.np/). 

This award makes its way at a time when Nepal is facing probably the biggest challenge towards reducing Gender Based Violence post Nepal Earthquake. We are extremely delighted and equally encouraged to use the momentum to bring the social change we dream of bringing. Kudos to the project! Letâ€™s Fight Violence Against Women, together!
