Continuing the support it gives tech community in Nepal, YoungInnovations participated in the Google Dev Fest organized by the Google Developers Group (GDG) Kathmandu on 20th December 2014 at Trade Tower Business Center, Thapathali, Nepal. Mr. Anjan Shrestha, co-founder and VP, Product Innovations and Mr. Rakeeb Rajbhandari, Android Developer at YoungInnovations shared their ideas on [What and How of Material Design on Android](https://speakerdeck.com/anjhero/implementing-material-design-in-android).

[Google devfest](http://googledevs.com/devfest/) is an annual event that brings together technology enthusiasts who participate in talk shows, seminars, training, presentation and workshops and discuss the latest Google technology along with its applications. Developers, designers and entrepreneurs who use Google technology in their everyday life unite to talk about the possibilities, opportunities and success stories using these products and technology. YoungInnovations presented their ideas on Material Design on Android using Google Technology. 

Google adopted material design to ensure uniform experience whether you use the application in your mobile, tablet or laptop. It also allows the developers a chance to come up with applications that give people an enriched interface and a better experience. YoungInnovations presented the background of Material Design along with possible ways to incorporate these ideas in applications. Mr. Anjan explained the theories about steps that need to be taken for Material designing while Mr. Rakeeb shared the codes to get the designs running in an application.

The idea of the presentation was to share a new idea with the objective of assisting the new developers and helping them gain additional expertise in a global phenomenon that Google has introduced. This globally accepted designing idea can now be used by the developers in Nepal for their application, making their products competitive in the global community both in terms of expertise and experience.
