                <p>
                We prefer students in their final years and of those colleges/universities where internship is part of the curriculum. However other students may also apply if you think you can commit time for learning. We don't expect you to know everything except that you have knack for learning and programming.

                The internship period will be 3 months from <strong>Nov 2014 - Jan 2015</strong>.

                <h3>What will you do?</h3>
                <p>
                You will be doing self-learning most of the time. We will just guide you. Already have something in mind to create, we will have those implemented as a part of your project. Don't know what to do, we will find the project together. Together we will create something that has value, something you will be proud of.
