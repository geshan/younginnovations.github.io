<p>Continuing passionate work in areas stimulating the existing mobile community in Nepal, YoungInnovations recently facilitated the planning and implementation of <a href="http://ncellappcamp.com/" target="_blank">Ncell App Camp, 2014</a>. The idea was to promote and support entrepreneurial ideas within mobile ecosystem of Nepal. Innovative mobile app ideas and products which have the ability to stand as a business were nurtured, appreciated and rewarded in the event.
</p>

<p>Nell App Camp called for participants and received 457 ideas under four categories, namely, agriculture, corporate solutions, education and tourism out of which 150 were selected. The selected participants attended thematic seminars and training on development and designing of mobile apps, business development and pitching & presentation from November 4-21, 2014. Finally, on December 2, 2014, top 24 finalists were selected by independent selection panel members. On the grand finale from December 9-11, the finalists from four different categories pitched their business ideas and demonstrated their product in front of judges. The best from each category, viz ICT for Agriculture, SentiNep, Corporate Solutions, RitiRiwaj and Lipi (The Script) won the final award of Rs. 250,000 from agriculture, corporate solutions, education and tourism sector respectively. The grand prize winner, ICT for Agriculture, won Rs. 500,000 for their outstanding product among the 24 finalists. All the winners will now work to create a complete product with sound technology and business model.</p>
