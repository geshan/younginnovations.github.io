MobileMonday™(MoMo) is an open community of mobile industry visionaries, developers and influential individuals fostering brand neutral cooperation and cross-border P2P business opportunities through live networking events to demo products, share ideas and discuss trends from both local and global markets. YoungInnovations introduced Mobile Monday in Nepal in 2013.  

Mobile Monday was organized by Namaste Kathmandu on December 6, 2015 in Kathmandu. It was the third time that this event was celebrated in Kathmandu (the first two organized by YoungInnovations) and what a crowd we saw! We had tech enthusiasts from around Kathmandu participate in an engaging discussion that revolved around startups, the pros and cons of having mobile application as a business in Nepal. Mr. Bibhusan Bista, CEO of YoungInnovations moderated the panel discussion on prospects of technology development  in Nepal. YoungInnovations also helped with the publicity of MoMo this year. 

Mr. Ajit Kumar Baral is nineteen and he is just getting his hands wet in the pool that is application development. This Mobile Monday, Ajit talked about his life as a programmer. He told the audience why people should take up programming in the first place. He suggested the right course to maximize the learning process and increase confidence in developing applications. Ajit’s presentation gave an insight on what young people expected of this field in Kathmandu. His enthusiasm was viral and the audience was eager to move on to the next speaker. 

Mr. Bimal Maharjan then brilliantly pulled the attention towards the challenges for tech startup in Nepal. He talked about the app trend in the world highlighting the challenges that can come up for revenue generation in this field. He then talked about challenges specific to Nepal, from limited number of innovators to lack of trend of paying for the applications. Early innovators anywhere have challenge, accentuated Bimal, and Nepal is in that early phase of welcoming innovation. So tech startup, is not a piece of a cake. It is lucrative if we look at the world scenario but in Nepal, we still have a lot of work to do. 

Mr. Suman Shakya is a businessman who knows the ins and outs of working in this field in Nepal. He discussed the business side of technology. To the crowd, he was someone who looked at an application as a product that needed to be marketed and sold rather than mere technological development. As the statistics suggest that 80 per cent of the startups fail, taking tech startup any differently, is definitely a mistake. Businesses change and grow and vanish. Focus on the customer's needs and wants, on what the customers are looking for with constant updates and methods to incorporate changes, are all necessary to sustain a business. Ideas change and so do needs. In the field of technology, the trend is even faster. Suman Shakya suggested we know the need and then focus on catering to the needs of the people. His first suggestion, if something doesn't work for 15 months, leave it and move on to something else. 

Panelists Anand Raj Khanal, Director of Nepal Telecommunication Authority; Subash Sharma, Vice President of F1Soft; Bal Krishna Joshi, Thamel.com and motivational speaker & trainer, Suman Shakya moderated by Bibhusan Bista engaged the audience in an invigorating discussion on the prospects and challenges of start ups in Nepal. The discussion started with the latest in the field of technology. It quickly moved to what is expected of start ups. There was also an interesting discussion on what the government has planned for the next five years, when it comes to development of ICT. 

The overall event garnered as much praise as any successful MobileMonday event organized worldwide. It was engaging. It was informative. It was interesting. We hope the next event is even bigger and better!
