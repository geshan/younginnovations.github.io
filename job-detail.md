        <div class="job-about__description">
         <p>
         Young Innovations builds custom products across several languages - PHP, Python, Node JS and Javascript - for a broad range of clients within the global development sector. We see QA as a preventative measure rather than a curative one - providing feedback that allows developers to improve the software from the start - and as such,  you will be ultimately responsible for the overall quality of the code deployed into our production.</p>
         <p>
         You will work closely with the Head of Product, the Chief Innovations Officer and the Director or Operations to create and implement processes which identify, analyze and document defects, functions, errors, and more in software. You will be an advocate for consistent and high quality standards across all of the company’s products, crafting best practices for coding and documenting code. We expect you to be heavily involved in the long term design and architectural decisions of both our QA process and product builds. </p>
