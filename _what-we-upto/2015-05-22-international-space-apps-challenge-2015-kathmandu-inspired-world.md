On April 11-12, 2015, 63 participants worked under 25 challenges put forward by NASA and on local challenges specific to Nepal, to celebrate International Space Apps Challenge for the third time in Nepal. There were 14 teams, 11 working on global and 3 on local challenges. Throughout the two days, enthusiastic participants impressed and inspired each other with innovative solutions to the challenges. At the end of the event, we hoped to create a lasting impact among these young participants. But it did much more. 

[Tracking and Sensing through Android Robotics](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/project/tracking-and-sensing-through-android-robotics/) solving the [‘Sensor Yourself’](https://2015.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/sensor-yourself/) challenge managed to inspire not just co-participants and judges, but the entire world. It won the Most Inspirational title in Global Competition of International Space Apps Challenge 2015.  [The team has been invited to attend September launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida of SpaceX’s eighth commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasa.gov%2Ffeature%2Fnasa-announces-winners-of-2015-international-space-apps-challenge&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEpJ9eSSMfANOKXiamxHtvYzba4SQ). This leap from Kathmandu to Florida is a celebration that cannot go unnoticed. 

Tracking and Sensing through Android Robotics wishes to revolutionize robotics in Nepal through the use of smartphones. NASA and MIT have used smartphones in robotics that has shown incredible potential of Android-powered robots. Building robots in Nepal, albeit challenging, is an opportunity that can solve considerable real life problems. Tracking and Sensing through Android Robotics can be used from navigating through mountains for waste disposal, to tracking geological artifacts, scanning atmospheric regions, and possibly even assisting in the search of extraterrestrial objects. 

In the third year of organizing International Space Apps Challenge in Nepal, [YoungInnovations](http://younginnovations.com.np/) in partnership with [ICIMOD](http://www.icimod.org/) under the framework of [SERVIR Himalaya](http://www.icimod.org/?q=471) and in collaboration with [Alternative Energy Promotion Center (AEPC) Nepal](http://www.aepc.gov.np/), has managed to bring forward creative and innovative minds and this year, the event managed to create a platform that received global acclaim. We hope to continue the trend and promote young minds with incredible potential helping them move towards global platform that can be an enriching experience to the participants, to the organizers and eventually to Nepal as well.
