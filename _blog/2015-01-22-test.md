Young Innovations shared its story of implementing [SMS based reporting system on National Immunization Program](http://nip.org.np).

Through the discussion, panelists agreed that innovation was undoubtedly a very pervasive medium today to ensure social impact and accountability. Implementing programs through innovative measures, however, requires additional homework on its feasibility since technology needs to be explained clearly, accurately and often repeatedly before it is understood. Training and formal education incorporating new and important innovations can be a good way to move forward. Including local people and organizations in utilizing innovations can mean better accountability from local bodies.
