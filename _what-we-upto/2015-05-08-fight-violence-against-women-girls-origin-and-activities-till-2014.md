Violence against women and girls (VAWG) is collectively referred to as violent activities that are primarily or exclusively committed against women and girls. 

[Fight Violence Against Women and Girls ](http://fightvaw.org/)(FightVAWG) is an internet based initiative that provides survivors and witnesses of VAWG incidents with the alternative means of reporting and enhancing coordination among organizations that provide care and services. FightVAWG has five solutions, viz, Your Voice Our Support, Case Management System, Self Help, Stakeholders Mapping and Media Monitoring. Your Voice Our Support is an automated helpline for survivors or third parties to report VAWG incidents via Call, SMS and Online. Case Management System is an online system to manage cases of VAWG that allows service providers to collaborate and exchange information, keep track of individual case history and generate reports as required. Self Help is an android app that equips women and girls with the easy to operate tool for alerting their closed friends and family in case of emergency. Stakeholders Mapping is a searchable repository of organisations located in different parts of the country who are actively working on Gender Based Violence (GBV). Media Monitoring is an automated tool to constantly monitor, analyse and maintain records of VAWG incidents that have been reported in mainstream media. FightVAWG also allows stories to be told under “Mero Katha” which is a platform to showcase the inspiring stories of VAWG survivors who have overcome the challenges.    

FightVAWG is a followup of  [Violence Against Women Hackathon (VAWHack)](http://vawhack.org) conducted on June 16, 2013 to assess the role of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in providing tools that may be useful in the prevention of VAWG and provision of support services. [The World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org/), [International Finance Corporation (IFC)](http://www.ifc.org), YoungInnovations and the [Computer Association of Nepal ](http://www.can.org.np/)(CAN) jointly organized the event. VAWHack brought together gender experts and technologists to explore innovative solutions in helping survivors of violence along with the agencies that work to support them. It brought together around 100 technologists and CSOs’ representatives under the same roof who developed and worked on 18 brilliant ideas to fight VAWG. Three winners were announced at the end of the day: ‘[Your Voice Our Support](http://vawhack.org/project/your-voice-our-support)’, ‘[Mero Katha](http://vawhack.org/project/mero-katha)’ and ‘[Self Help](http://vawhack.org/project/self-help)’ who won first, second and third prizes respectively. Prototypes of these three winning teams along with ‘VAW repo and Social Campaigning’ were taken and integrated to form the FightVAWG system.  

Civil society organizations (CSOs) with their partners appreciated the efforts of VAWHack and they expressed the need to follow-up on the outcome of VAWHack because the applications developed demonstrated immense potential to address challenges faced by survivors and providers of support services. Similarly, different stakeholders also showed interest in using ICT in the area of VAWG for reporting VAWG incidents, coordinating response to  VAWG cases, creating database of organizations working in VAWG, monitoring news and data on VAWG and creating a platform to provide positive stories to inspire women and girls.
  
YoungInnovations was a part of FightVAWG project since its conception. With the support of the World Bank, YoungInnovations integrated the four prototypes of VAWHack to develop single system which handles reports and maintains coordination amongst the CSOs that provide their services to survivors. It also includes an android application. The system has been made more appropriate, flexible and easy where different CSOs can work within same case. Re-victimization issue has also been reduced with the help of FightVAWG. It has made it easy to report VAWG incidents through call,sms or online that will be recorded rather than having the survivors  provide information face to face over and over again. Along with constant improvements in system and application, YoungInnovations is working with the World Bank and partner CSOs to practice the system in Nepal. FightVAWG system, technically managed and coordinated by YoungInnovations, has been currently involved in creating standardised case management system for four organizations namely: [SAATHI](http://www.saathi.org.np/), [LACC](http://www.laccnepal.org/),[CWIN](http://www.cwin.org.np/) and [TPO-Nepal](http://www.tponepal.org/).
