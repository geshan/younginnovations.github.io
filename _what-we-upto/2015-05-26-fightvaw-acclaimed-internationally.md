[YoungInnovations](http://younginnovations.com.np/) is extremely proud to announce that one of its projects, [Fight Violence Against Women (FightVAW)](http://fightvaw.org/) has won international acclaim. It has been awarded the [WSIS Project Prizes](http://groups.itu.int/stocktaking/WSISProjectPrizes.aspx) under the Category 1: The role of governments and all stakeholders in the promotion of ICTs for development (C1). 

[World Summit on Information Society (WSIS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society) Project Prizes is a unique recognition for excellence in the implementation of WSIS outcomes. This initiative is an immediate response to the requests expressed by WSIS stakeholders during the [WSIS Forum 2011](http://groups.itu.int/wsis-forum2011/Home.aspx): to create a mechanism to evaluate and reward stakeholders for their efforts in the implementation of WSIS outcomes. It is a contest that is open to all stakeholders - governments, private sectors, civil society, international organizations, academia and others. There are 18 categories that are directly linked to [WSIS Action lines](https://www.itu.int/wsis/stocktaking/help-action-lines.html) outlined in the [Geneva Plan of Action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Summit_on_the_Information_Society#Geneva_Summit.2C_2003). 

FightVAW is an ICT-based initiative that provides survivors of Violence against Women (VAW) an alternative means of reporting their case via phone call, SMS and online. It uses integrated case management system to assist survivors of VAW and organizations engaged in reducing its impact in Nepalese society. 

This award makes its way at a time when Nepal is facing probably the biggest challenge towards reducing Gender Based Violence post Nepal Earthquake. We are extremely delighted and equally encouraged to use the momentum to bring the social change we dream of bringing. Kudos to the project! Letâ€™s Fight Violence Against Women, together!
