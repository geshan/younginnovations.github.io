                We prefer students in their final years and of those colleges/universities where internship is part of the curriculum.

                You will be doing self-learning most of the time. We will just guide you. Already have something in mind to create, we will have those implemented as a part of your project. Don't know what to do, we will find the project together. Together we will create something that has value, something you will be proud of.
